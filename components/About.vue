        <h4>Who We Are</h4>
        <p class="text-body-2">
          Imchatty is a project by
          <a href="https://oliverwjones..com">Oliver W. Jones</a>, a seasoned
          player in the IT consulting industry. We created this site to delve
          deeper into real-time database and presence technology, AI chatbots
          and LLM's. We're using Imchatty as a dynamic sandbox for testing and
          development. We'd love to see how far we can push this technology and
          if we can build something useful. You'll find the Open Source code for
          this site <a href="https://github.com/jefhild/NuxtChat">here</a>.
